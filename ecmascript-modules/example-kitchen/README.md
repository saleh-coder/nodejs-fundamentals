# Example Kitchen - ECMAScript Modules

This folder demonstrates how to simulate kitchen actions using ECMAScript modules. You'll learn to combine different food items with cooking actions to create meals.

## Structure

- **kitchen/cookingActions.js**: Contains functions like `boil`, `bake`, and `fry`.
- **kitchen/food.js**: Defines food items and their properties.
- **kitchen/main.js**: Combines actions and food items into recipes.
- **meal.js**: Assembles meals from recipes.
- **recipe.js**: Creates step-by-step instructions for cooking meals.
- **index.js**: Entry point that showcases how all modules work together.

## Key Concepts

- Importing and exporting ES modules.
- Organizing and simulating real-world tasks in code.
- Combining functionality across multiple files.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the **example-kitchen/** folder.
2. Run the `index.js` file:
   ```bash
   node --experimental-modules index.js
   ```
3. Explore the outputs to see how meals are created and cooked.

Enjoy exploring kitchen simulations! üç≥
